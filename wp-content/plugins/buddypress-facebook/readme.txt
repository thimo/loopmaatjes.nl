== Description ==


Let your members and groups show their Facebook Button on their profile page and group page. 

Using full Facebook URL (www.facebook.com/username), the plugin fetches your members and/or groups username and displays their button in the member's/group's header.

If your BuddyPress community is active on Facebook, this plugin is a great tool for boosting communication both on and off your website.
It's really easy to setup, even if you have an existing community:

Members: Once you ( the site admin ) have set up the members component, all your members have to do is enter in their full Facebook URL and existing members via editing their profile settings.

Groups: Once you ( the site admin ) have set up the groups component, all your group admins have to do is enter in their associated full Facebook URL when they create a group and existing groups via editing their group's details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What is the 'Group Field Title' for? =

The group field title is the title that will be displayed right above the text box where the group will enter in their complete Facebook URL: www.facebook.com/username.

= Will the 'Mirror Profile Field Title' also be displayed above the text box where the member will enter in their Facebook name.? =

No, the text box will use the title you gave your Xprofile field as described in step 6 of the plugin installation instructions. The 'Mirror Profile Field Title' is used to fetch the members meta ( attached data ) though if the two differ, no data will be returned thus no button will display.
