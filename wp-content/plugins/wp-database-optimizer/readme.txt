Ever wished that you could take some measure to speed up your Wordpress site? Have you created and deleted a lot of posts as well as experimented with plugins? All these deleted entries leave overhead on the database that should be routinely cleared out. This plugin allows you to have your Wordpress tables to be optimized on a schedule. It uses the Wordpress Database Class to do the work, and you can set the number of days in between optimizations.

1. Upload `wp_database_optimizer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
