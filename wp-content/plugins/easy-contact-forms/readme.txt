= 1. Visitor friendly contact forms. =

No one likes filling out forms. This is an axiom. A good contact form is a contact form, which is comfortable for site visitors. Period.
A contact form, designed in a visitor friendly way, is never an accident. There are too many things to consider: form responsiveness, label placement, form design or suggestions you add.
The world admires people who has brilliant intuition, but, for the rest of us, there is only one working formula: MEASURE and CHANGE, and then MEASURE and CHANGE again.
Anyone can select the measurement tool they want to use: which one they like better, Google analytics or the amount of cash he has in his pocket.
Easy Contact Forms is a tool helping to  change a site's front door (Aka a contact form). A minute will be enough to change the contact form layout. A few minutes will be enough to add several fields.
